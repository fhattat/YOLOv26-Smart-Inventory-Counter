        "\n",
        "This project demonstrates a real-time Computer Vision solution designed for automated inventory management in industrial environments. Using the state-of-the-art YOLOv26 object detection architecture, the system identifies, tracks, and counts items (e.g., fruits) moving on a conveyor belt with high precision.Unlike standard counting methods that rely on simple line-crossing algorithms, this project implements a Custom Buffer Zone Logic to ensure 100% accuracy. This approach mitigates common issues such as double-counting caused by video jitter or object occlusion.\n",

        "🎯 Key Features\n",
        "\n",
        "Object Detection: Fine-tuned YOLOv26 model to detect specific objects (e.g., Apples) from a custom dataset.Persistent Tracking: Utilizes advanced tracking algorithms (BoT-SORT/ByteTrack) to assign unique IDs to moving objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Robust Counting Logic: Implements a \"Safety Corridor\" (Buffer Zone) mechanism. Objects are counted only when their centroid coordinates stabilize within a specific vertical range ($X \\pm Offset$).\n",
        "\n",
        "Real-Time Dashboard: Displays live analytics including bounding boxes, tracking IDs, and total count directly on the video feed.\n",
